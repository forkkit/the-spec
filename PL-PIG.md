# Pattern Lab Port Interop Group (PL-PIG)

Project representatives can use this venue to discuss the commonalities between ports and find ways to standardize our work together.

## Proposing a Recommendation for a Spec

To propose a Pattern Lab Spec Recommendation (PLSR):

- create a ticket to start a discussion on Github; or,

- start a conversation on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/pattern-lab/spec) room

## Voting Protocol for a Recommendation for a Spec

1. Only voting members may initiate a call for votes on a measure.

2. Only voting members may vote on a measure.

3. The time limit on a vote is 14 days from the time of the call for votes, or
until all voting members have cast their vote, whichever comes first. Votes
cast after the time limit are not valid.

4. Votes can be +1 ("in favor"), -1 ("against"), or 0 ("abstain").

5. Two-thirds or more of the *voting members* must vote within the time limit
for the vote to be valid.

6. The measure passes if a simple majority of the *votes cast* are "in favor".
The measure does not pass otherwise.

7. Measures passed are not binding. A vote "in favor" of a measure is an
indication that the measure is approved, but the voting member may not be able
to apply it immediately for reasons outside the purview of this group.
